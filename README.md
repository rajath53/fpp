# Flight Price Prediction with deployment

### I have built a simple web app model which predicts the price of flight given the departure time , arrival time , date of journey , airline etc !

### This was a fun project as the dataset which I had was categorical and to convert that into meaningful and mapping numerical values took me some time !
### The accuracy on test data is 80 % and for the train data it goes to 95 %
### I have also included the dataset (air_train.xlsx and air_test.xlsx) , the jupyter notebook(main code) file and the pickle file !

# Demo Link
### https://flight-price-predictionmlapp.herokuapp.com/

# Deployment.
### Heroku
### Frontend and Backend -- Streamlit

# Steps to follow after cloning :

### 1.place the pickle file in the same directory
### 2.Run the ipynb file
### 3. Use streamlit and heroku for the deployment

### Any issue or requirement if necessary , you can raise a request !

# Thank you !
